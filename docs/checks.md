# Checks catalog

A failed "Stop" check ends the run before anything is exported. The export itself is gated (`src/pipeline/gate.py`): it refuses to run when the database has a failed check, when a newer build failed (the database is stale), or when `docs/parity/summary.csv` is missing or has an unexplained difference. `make test-fault` shows a damaged extract failing its checks while the last good database is kept.

| Agency results rows = matched Managing for Results rows | mart | Stop | 4 | yes |
| Each dashboard-file mart = the legacy file (or the difference explained) | mart | Stop (`make parity`) | 4 | yes: 12 of 21 exact, 9 explained |
| Exported files differ from last run | mart | Report the changes | 4 | yes (`export.py` writes `changed` per file to `manifest.csv`) |
| Forecast ranges ordered (p10 <= p50 <= p90) | mart | Stop | 5 | yes |
| Forecast actuals add up to controllable purchases (every actual year); FY2025 baseline = the area's actual | mart | Stop | 5 | yes |

| The path to $50M is numbered, adds up, and agrees with recommendation 4's status | mart | Stop | 5 | yes |
| Vendor drill-downs tie to their payee names, and every bid-list vendor has one | mart | Stop | 5 | yes |
| Most of the path to $50M does not rest on assumed saving rates | mart | Warn | 5 | yes |

| Every year whose portal stage label differs from the confirmed stage has evidence | mart | Stop | 5 | yes |

The legacy pipeline ran about 90 checks (see the GMI Savings Tracker's Data & pipeline tab); phases 2–5 port them here.
