# Data governance — GMI Savings Tracker

<!-- gen:stamp -->
_Generated 2026-11-09T21:49Z by `python -m src.pipeline.governance`. Source schemas from the Discovery API, read Nov 09, 2026._
<!-- /gen:stamp -->

The rules for where the tracker's data comes from, what every column means, who can change what, and how every figure is backed by a source. The schema sections are rebuilt from the sources on every run (`python -m src.pipeline.governance`), so they can't fall out of date. The policy sections are written by hand.

## 1. Scope and roles

Covers every dataset the pipeline reads, every table it builds (DuckDB layers `raw`, `ref`, `core`, `mart`, `ops`), and every file the dashboard publishes.

| Role | Who | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Data owner (source) | Maryland Department of Budget and Management (DBM) | Publishes budget, funding, positions, payments and grants data |
| Source maintainer | Maryland Department of Information Technology (DoIT) | Uploads and maintains the portal datasets (portal metadata) |
| Data steward | Sierra Napier (repo owner, `@EVO3-Ecosystem` in CODEOWNERS) | Approves reference-data changes, assumptions and citations; resolves pending decisions |
| Pipeline | `src/pipeline/*` and the GitHub Actions workflow | Extracts, builds, checks, documents; blocks publishing on a failed stop check |

The tracker is an independent prototype, not an official State of Maryland product.

## 2. Source registry

Portal datasets (from the Discovery API; owner, licence and dates are the portal's own metadata):

## 3. Known source issues

Each issue was checked against the portal's own metadata or the data on Nov 2, 2026, and is handled in code.

| Dataset | Issue | Evidence | Handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| All five | The portal gives no column descriptions | Every `columns_description` is empty in the Discovery API | Definitions in `reference/column_dictionary.csv` (section 11) |
| Payments (7syw-q4cy) | Title says "FY2008 to FY2024"; data runs through FY2027 | Portal title vs downloaded years | Years read from the data, not the title |
| Payments | Includes individuals, not only businesses | Portal description: "private businesses, local governments, non-profit organizations, and individuals" | See section 9 |
| Payments | No minimum amount (an earlier version of the dashboard said "$25,000 or more", which was wrong) | 5,122 of 23,221 FY2025 payments are under $25,000; smallest is $0.33 | Description corrected Nov 2, 2026 |
| Payments | `date` and `fiscal_period` are placeholders | Values repeat the fiscal-year end | Not used |
| Payments | Agency names, not codes | Schema has `agency_name` only | `ref.map_payment_agency` (rules + decisions) |
| Payments | Latest year is partial | Monthly updates (portal metadata) | `partial_year` flag |
| Grants (absk-avps) | Description says "$50,000 or more", but smaller rows exist | 1,726 of 23,085 rows are under $50,000 | Description corrected; no filter applied |
| Grants (absk-avps) | Grantor is free text "Agency/Program" with no agency code: 1,944 spellings, mixed case (WMATA grants appear under Transportation in at least five forms) | Distinct grantor values, Nov 5, 2026 | Listed as published in `mart.f_grants`; grouping grantors into agencies and programs is a next-phase step (`docs/roadmap.md`) |
| Grants vs payments | Grants are likely paid out through the payments data, so the two overlap | 13-75% of grant dollars a year go to grantees also paid that year (FY2017-FY2025, exact name match, a lower bound) | `mart.f_overlap`; grants shown as part of payments, never added to them |
| Budget vs payments | Each budget year has one stage (actuals replace the appropriation), and payments leave out payroll but include capital and pass-through money | `ref.budget_stage`; payments are 66-78% of the budget | `mart.f_budget_vs_pay` keeps them side by side with the stage; no budget-vs-actual variance until original appropriations are sourced |
| Budget (yu65-jmmv) | `type` (stage) column is out of date | Compared with DBM budget books | `ref.budget_stage` from mtp.maryland.gov and the budget books |
| Funding source (gy87-e27x), FTE (x8qy-486w) | Descriptions still say FY2026 is the Governor's Allowance; data runs to FY2027 | Portal description vs data | Same stage table as the budget |
| Budget | Code spellings vary ("0930"/"930", "1"/"01"); function codes 10–12 have more than one title; A15's name carries ":A15" in FY2026–FY2027 | Phase 2 checks | Normalized in `core` |
| All five | 50,000-row pages drop without an app token | Phase 1 runs | 20,000-row pages, retries, self-healing re-download |
| Budget (yu65-jmmv) vs higher education (4mca-332u) | The operating budget dataset leaves out public higher education: R13 Morgan State, R14 St. Mary's College, R30 University System of Maryland and R95 Baltimore City Community College are published separately as CUR and CR funds | Checked Nov 4, 2026 (no rows for the four agencies in yu65-jmmv); stop check on every build since Nov 9, 2026 | `raw.highered` / `core.fact_budget_highered` with `source_dataset`; added only in `mart.d_all_funds`, labeled "including public higher education"; out of every GMI savings baseline (below) |

## 5. Quality controls

`docs/checks.md` lists every check with its layer, severity and phase. Rules:

- A **Stop** check that fails exits non-zero, keeps the last good database, and saves the failed build as `md_transparency.failed.duckdb`. Nothing is published.
- A **Warn** check is recorded and shown, but doesn't block.
- Every result is stored in `ops.check_result` and appended to `data/check_history.csv`. Every run, including failed runs, is appended to `data/runs.csv`.
- Totals must tie to the portal's own `sum()` to the cent, and budget totals to funding-source totals within $1.

## 6. Reference data change control

Every mapping rule, scope rule and manual decision is a CSV in `reference/`, reviewed through a pull request (CODEOWNERS). No rule lives only in code.

| File | Governs |
|---|---|
| `payment_agency_rules.csv` | How payment agency names map to budget agency codes |
| `payment_agency_decisions.csv` | Manual mapping decisions, with `decided_by` and `date` (pending rows need a decision) |
| `vendor_normalization.csv`, `vendor_families.csv` | How payee names are cleaned and grouped into companies |
| `payee_focus_area.csv`, `focus_area_rules.csv` | Which spending belongs to each GMI focus area |
| `controllable_rules.csv` | What counts as controllable purchases |
| `budget_stage.csv` | Confirmed stage of each budget year, with its source |
| `gmi_reported_savings.csv` | Every reported saving, with source, page and quote |
| `mfr_agency_map.csv` | Managing for Results plan files to agency codes |
| `baseline_quality.csv` | Match rates the pipeline must not fall below |
| `payee_type_rules.csv` | Payee type of every vendor (Government, Health care organization, Education institution, Financial institution, Utility, Non-profit, Business or other), in priority order |
| `function_exceptions.csv` | Payment accounts the operating budget data doesn't carry (capital accounts, independent authorities), named instead of given a function |
| `column_dictionary.csv` | The definition of every column (this document) |

**Public higher education and GMI savings baselines (Nov 9, 2026).** The four higher-education agencies (4mca-332u) are kept out of every savings baseline: the budget detectors never see them (they are not in yu65-jmmv), and `config/assumptions.yaml` (`gmi_baseline_exclusions`, `savings.vendor_moves.excluded_agency_codes`) drops their payments (only R95 appears in the payments data, about $16M of private payments a year) from the payment detectors, the bid list and the vendor moves. A stop check on every build confirms it. Their budget appears only in the all-funds total labeled "including public higher education" (`mart.d_all_funds`, `d_all_funds.csv`). The reason given in the roadmap, that these institutions buy under their own procurement authority outside the executive-branch procurement GMI works through, **rests on statute citations that have not been verified**; no citation is published until it is checked against the Annotated Code of Maryland (State Finance and Procurement Article) and the institutions' own procurement policies.

**Deferred (Nov 9, 2026):** `mart.payment_area` holds one row per payment, so `mart.payment_line` would be the accurate name (roadmap gap 10). The rename is deferred: eight marts and three models read it by name. `core.fact_fund` now keeps unit and program (the other half of gap 10).

Portal views reproduced as marts: where it's going (`mart.f_program`, budget by agency, unit and program), how it's funded (`mart.f_fund_source`, budget by named fund source), grants and loans as listed (`mart.f_grants`), and the overlap evidence that ties them to payments (`mart.f_budget_vs_pay`, `mart.f_overlap`). Real and per-resident dollars: `mart.d_deflator` (`d_deflator.csv`: CPI-U fiscal-year average, the factor from nominal to FY2026 dollars, and Maryland's July 1 population; FY2026 averages 11 months because BLS published no October 2025 CPI). Detector backtest: `mart.d_detector_backtest` (`docs/models/opportunities.md`).

## 7. Citations

- Every reported saving has a source, URL, page and verbatim quote in `reference/gmi_reported_savings.csv`. The run fails if any is missing ("Every reported savings item cites its source and page").
- A figure the sources don't publish is not filled in. For example, GMI names four contract types under the $18M but no vendors and no split, so the tracker checks payment categories and labels each match as a best match.
- Cost avoidance (DGS $326.3M) is kept apart from recurring yearly savings.
- **Needs verification before publishing:** the procurement-statute citations for leaving public higher education out of GMI's scope (section 6). The pipeline publishes none.

## 8. Assumptions register

Values that are not published by any source. Each one is labeled as an assumption wherever the dashboard shows it.

| Assumption | Value | Where used | Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| Statewide contract saving (bid list) | 2–5% of FY2026 payments | Opportunities, bid list | `recs.py bid_list` |
| Statewide contract saving (path to $50M) | 3.5% | Path to $50M | `recs.py plan50` |
| Starting savings in real estate and utilities | 1% of forecast spending | Path to $50M | `recs.py plan50` |
| Peer gap detector | 5–15% of the gap above the 75th percentile (capped at 3–10% of budget) | Opportunities | `opportunities.py` |
| Growth above trend detector | 10–30% of the excess growth | Opportunities | `opportunities.py` |
| Tail spend detector | 3–10% of spending outside the top 10 vendors | Opportunities | `opportunities.py` |
| Leverage detector | 2–5% of payments to vendors paid by 10 or more agencies (at least $5M) | Opportunities | `opportunities.py` |
| Delivery range (Monte Carlo) | 50–125% of each savings rate | Calculator | `index.html caSim` |
| Payment-match tolerance | "Seen" when the payment drop is at least 50% of the reported saving | Savings tracker | `recs.py recurrence` |

Not assumptions, and sourced: the default savings rates (GMI's reported recurring savings ÷ FY2025 spending), and the fee (20% of savings, $15M cap; WYPR).

## 9. Privacy, licence and security

- **Licence:** all five portal datasets are Public Domain (portal metadata).
- **Individuals:** the payments and grants data include individuals. The tracker analyzes companies: payee names are grouped into vendors, and the vendor views list companies paid by many agencies. Individual payee names must not be featured in published views or exports. *Open item:* add a check that flags payee names that look like a person's name in any published vendor table.
- **Secrets:** `MD_SODA_APP_TOKEN` and `BLS_API_KEY` live only in GitHub Actions secrets or a local `.env` (in `.gitignore`), never in the repo.
- **Access:** the dashboard is a private artifact until the owner shares it.
- **Open classification item:** the payee "MARYLAND CARE INC" ($1.31B in FY2025, paid by the Health function) is left as "Business or other". Its name does not match any of the nine HealthChoice MCOs on the Department of Health's chart (2/1/26), and we could not confirm which plan it is; classify it only with a source.

## 10. Retention and versioning

- Raw files: `data/raw/<run_id>/` (Parquet + manifest). Unchanged sources are hard-linked, not copied.
- Database: the last good `data/md_transparency.duckdb` is kept until a build passes.
- Run and check history: `data/runs.csv`, `data/check_history.csv` (append-only); uploaded as run evidence by the workflow.
- Payee-name history: `data/payee_name_seen.csv`, loaded as `ops.payee_name_seen` (one row per payee name: first and last extract run and date seen). Only a build whose stop checks all pass writes it; a rerun of the same extract run moves `last_seen` and adds nothing; a failed build writes nothing. The warn check "New payee names since the last build" lists names no passing build of an earlier extract run has seen (it replaced `data/payee_names.txt`, which every build overwrote, failed or not).
- Rules, citations and this document: versioned in git.
- Source schema snapshots: `docs/schemas/catalog_snapshot.json`; changes go to `docs/schemas/drift_history.csv`.

## 11. Schemas

Also saved as CSV in `docs/schemas/` (`source_columns.csv`, `warehouse_columns.csv`, `dashboard_columns.csv`). Origin: **portal** = as published; **source** = other external source; **reference** = from `reference/*.csv`; **derived** = computed by the pipeline; **ops** = run metadata.
