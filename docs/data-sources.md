| Dataset | ID | Years | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Operating budget | yu65-jmmv | FY2017–FY2027 | Portal `type` column is out of date; stages follow mtp.maryland.gov: FY2017–FY2025 Actual, FY2026 Working, FY2027 Legislative Appropriation |
| Funding source | gy87-e27x | FY2017–FY2027 | Totals equal the budget within $1 |
| Budgeted positions (FTE) | x8qy-486w | FY2017–FY2027 | Extracted through the API like the others; the extract matches the portal's own count and yearly totals. The portal's View Data page has no website download to compare. Portal description still calls FY2026 the Governor's Allowance; stages follow `reference/budget_stage.csv` |
| Payments to vendors | 7syw-q4cy | FY2008–FY2027 | Agency names, not codes; FY2027 is a partial year; `date` and `fiscal_period` are placeholders |
| Grants and loans | absk-avps | | Year column is `fiscalyear` |

Quirks the code handles: 50,000-row pages drop without a token (use 20,000); sub-object codes in two spellings ("0930"/"930"); object and program codes "1"/"01"; function codes 10–12 carry more than one title (key by title); agency A15 named "…:A15" in FY2026–FY2027.
