"""The Overview's six recommendations as tracked tables (port of the plan, status and vendor-detail parts of
legacy/gst/scripts/recs.py).

  1. Bid statewide contracts for shared vendors      mart.d_bid_list (opportunities.py); detail below
  2. Confirm which reported savings recur            mart.d_savings_status (savings.py)
  3. Name the seven renegotiated contracts           the four named contract types, checked in d_savings_status
  4. Plan the rest of the path to $50M               mart.d_plan50: GMI's pace, then statewide contracts, then fallback areas
  5. Keep one vendor and agency master list          share of payments matched to an agency
  6. Tie spending to results                         Managing for Results measures read from the agency plans

Builds four dashboard files:
  d_plan50        the path to $50M a year, step by step, with a running total
  d_rec_status    one row per recommendation: a status, one key number, and the previous run's number
  f_vendor_detail payments by agency and year for every vendor an area page or the bid list links to
  d_vendor_names  the payee names merged into each of those vendors (FY2026 payments)

The plan is built from assumed rates, not evidence of what a renegotiation yields (config/assumptions.yaml,
`recommendations`). Differences from the legacy script: recommendation 6 is read from this pipeline's own
Managing for Results data instead of the legacy text "needs a data feed", which this pipeline made false; the history
behind `previous` is written only by builds that passed their checks.
