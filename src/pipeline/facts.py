"""Pipeline facts for the dashboard's Data & pipeline tab, from this pipeline's own records (not the legacy pipeline's).

Builds four dashboard files as mart tables, after the checks have run (two of them describe the checks):
  mart.sources         one row per portal dataset: ID, title, portal update date, rows, years, reconciled
  mart.run_checks      every check of this build (stage = layer: raw, core, ref, mart)
  mart.pipeline_runs   one row per extract run: status, timing, repairs, rows, and the checks of its build
  mart.d_master_quality  how well payments match the agency and vendor master lists

Column order and meaning follow docs/schemas/dashboard_columns.csv. Run history comes from data/runs.csv (extract
runs) and data/check_history.csv (builds), so it spans runs even though the database is rebuilt each time.
