"""Phase 2 — Database: data/raw/<run_id>/ -> data/md_transparency.duckdb (layers raw, ref, core, ops; mart in Phase 4).

Rebuilt from scratch on every run (seconds). raw is never edited: fixes happen in core or in reference CSVs.
Then src/pipeline/checks.py runs every check, writes ops.check_result and exits non-zero if a "stop" check fails.

Usage: python -m src.pipeline.build [run_id]   (default: the latest passed extract run)
